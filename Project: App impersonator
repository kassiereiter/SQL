Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app 
that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data 
in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.
